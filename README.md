# UltimakerRamps
Marlin firmware for the Ultimaker, upgraded to a RAMPS1.4 board and the J-Head hot-end

Warning: it seems that temperature0 is dead, so i switched out temp0 and temp1. 
This means that the heater-temperaturesensor needs to be attached to t1

## What to do when someone screws over the firmware
### Step One
Clone this repo. 

### Step Two
Open ````Marlin.ino```` with [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) (should be installed on the Stadslab computer already). Connect the Ultimaker to the computer (if not already). Press __upload__ .

### Step Three
???

### Step Four
Profit. The Ultimaker firmware should be succesfully uploaded to the Arduino Mega.
